# AI Ball Balancer
A small test of the Unity ML-Agents toolkit  
The agent is a reinforcement learning agent trained to balance a ball  
I also made a small minigame if you want to try to beat the AI: https://edz123.itch.io/ai-ball-balancer  
Use WASD or the arrow keys to rotate your cube and balance the ball for longer than the AI! (spoilers: you probably won't, it's kind of hard)
